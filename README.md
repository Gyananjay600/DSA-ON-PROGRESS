# 🚀 Java DSA – Basics (In Progress)

> This repository tracks my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey using **Java**. I have completed the **Java basics and foundational DSA concepts**, and this repo contains topic-wise practice programs inside the `src` folder.

## 📂 Project Structure

All my practice problems are organized topic-wise inside the `src` folder:

```
