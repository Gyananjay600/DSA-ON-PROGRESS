# 🚀 Taiyari DSA – Java Learning Journey

> This repository serves as a comprehensive log of my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** progress using **Java**. I am building a strong foundation in problem-solving, starting from basic syntax to advanced algorithmic patterns.

## 📂 Project Roadmap & Structure

I have organized the `src` folder into logical modules. Each folder contains high-quality practice problems and implementations.

### 🟢 Level 1: Fundamentals
* **Basics/** – Syntax, I/O operations, and data types.
* **Conditionals/** – Logical flow using `if-else` and `switch-case`.
* **LOOP/** – Iterative logic with `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
* **Methods/** – Modular programming and function implementation.
* **Patterns/ & PatternPractice/** – Logic building through visual nested loops.

### 🟡 Level 2: Data Structures & OOPS
* **Arrays/** – 1D array operations and memory management.
* **TwoD_Array/** – Matrix manipulations and 2D grid logic.
* **String/ & String_2/** – Comprehensive string handling and `StringBuilder` optimization.
* **OOPS/** – Object-Oriented principles (Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.).

### 🟠 Level 3: Algorithmic Techniques
* **BasicSortingAlgorithms/** – Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort.
* **Array_TwoPointer/** – Optimization techniques for linear search/sorting.
* **PrefixSum/** – Efficient range sum queries and cumulative logic.
